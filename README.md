This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various existing features. Data cleaning, data wrangling, and exploratory analysis were performed to identify the most relevant features (such as mileage, year, and engine size) and the target variable (car price). A Linear Regression model was then developed to predict car prices, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.77.
